For my final project I decided to continue on our previous assignment of interpretting Json files.<br>
I started off by creating a python program and figuring out how to import a Json file into a parsable format.<br>
After I had the Json imported, I had to figure out how to actually parse the data into something readable.<br>
This was where a significant chunk of my time was spent, coming up with a way to sift through my json in an organized manner.<br>
Once I got it working and a litle bit formatted I saw something like this:<br>

That was one string, one tuning, one frequency, now i needed to get every string in a tuning.<br>

This was better, at least I was getting the correct number of strings. Next I decided to try and grab every string from all tunings.<br>

Again, it's progressing, and at least the first string in each tuning is displaying, but its not iterating within each tuning, which was fairly easy to fix.<br>

There we go! Now all relevent information from the Json has been accessed, I could now do with it what I will.<br>
So I decided I was going to use the Tkinter library and try to build a somewhat acceptable graphical interface.<br>
I wanted to be able to click on a specific tuning frequency and hear it, and this turned out to be the hardest part of my project, but I got it to display!<br>

The biggest issue I ran into was, since I sorted all of my data into a 2D array of nearly identical Tkinter.Button objects, and all Button objects require a callback function on instantiation, I had no way to distinguish each button from eachother, they all called the same function.<br>
To fix this I created a dynamic callback function that accepted an int as a parameter and used lambda functions from within the button instantiation which allowed me to instantiate buttons with identical callback functions, but unique function parameters.<br>

This was my final result after cleaning up the GUI a bit,(evening out the buttons) and separating the tunings.
